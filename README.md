## coursera_scraper


### DISCLAIMER 1 : This is the most basic version of this task. Since there are many types of courses on Coursera, acknowleding all of them is a rather advanced task and requires more effort.

### DISCLAIMER 2 : Depending on the search query, the CSV file can become very large, and the scraping could take up to an hour

### DISCLAIMER 3 : I've used EXPATHS to extract data from Coursera. Websites like Coursera are known to change said expaths to avoid mass data extraction. 

### Technology Used: SELENIUM, Chrome Webdriver, Pandas



### Dependencies: Python 3.8+, Selenium 4.0+, Chrome web driver, Pandas
